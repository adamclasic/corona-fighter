<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

An RPG video game runs on HTML5 canvas built using Javascript and the game engine Phaser 3.
In this particular game the action is mainly focused on collecting as many stars as possible while having to combat against viruses.

### How to Play

![screenshot](./images//commands.png)

The game can be played using the arrow keys for moving the player and  for attacking the viruses.
By moving the player you will be able to collect chests that contain stars. Each star will update the score with 1 units.
As a bonus though, for each virus killed the player will recieve 10 units.

### Design Process

Fatal Warrior was designed on an initial, quite complex, webpack configuration specific for Phaser3. This allowed me to investigate Phaser and its tools from a specific perspective. The entire map was built with Tiled on a 32 x 32 collection of squares. The map then has been exported as a json file and used for placing chests, and monsters at random positions.

The player has a set velocity and can move across the map by using the arrow keys. Each time the player dies it will be spawned at a different random position to make the game more interesting. The monsters and the chests will be as well randomly generated and spawned on the map. Each spawned element has a random unique id used to interact with the user. The unique id is generated with the help of uuid npm package.

### Built With
This project was built using these technologies.
* JavaScript
* Phaser3
* Webpack
* Jest Tests
* Tiled Map
* GithubActions :muscle:
* Atom :atom:
